## An application where you can make certain filters about the car you are looking for and learn the average sales price of that car.

### In this project, you can help increase the data by registering as a user and giving information about the car you sell, while at the same time you can learn the estimated price of the car in the criteria you are looking for. The information you provide about your car is checked and approved or rejected by the admin, such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, country of origin and price.
